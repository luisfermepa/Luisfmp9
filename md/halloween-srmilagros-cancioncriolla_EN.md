Halloween, Sr. de los Milagros and Canci√≥n Criolla
</h3>

The life of the party has arrived xD. It's the second time in my life that I hear both a procession and ambulances on the same day (it doesn't mean they are related, maybe it's just a coincidence). Today in Peru there are three events: National Criolla Song Day, which seems to have fewer events every year (I almost forgot about it if it weren't for a friend's story about his company), Halloween, and the last day of the procession of the Lord of Miracles.

Many people are talking about Halloween parties and events (I don't see anything wrong with that, just mentioning it). In my family, I seem to be the only one who is not very religious (I'm agnostic). X was thinking about the turrones sold at the procession because they were outside on bicycles. When X mentioned it at lunch, I thought the same thing, and Y said, "Is that all you would want to go to the procession for?" and I thought, "Yes, what else is there to it? Does it serve any purpose?"

The Lord of Miracles is so miraculous that he can't make ambulances fly over his processions, or even better, teleport them, and he makes sick people walk who believe they will be cured by their simple faith, instead of seeking medical alternatives or stop wasting time on it (I also waste time and do negative things, I have vices or procrastinate, perhaps like most people, the problem is worse when you do something negative thinking it's positive or defending it or even promoting it).

But these beliefs are gradually losing strength due to natural selection (although it sounds harsh, people die from believing in it due to illnesses or generating crowds that can spread COVID, and they are less likely to leave inheritances). Crowds are also present at parties, although at parties, they are usually young people who perhaps know the risks better, but the problem is that they also put their families at risk. Although most of us are already vaccinated, there are people who have chosen not to be vaccinated, and natural selection will also come into play here.

It has been announced that parties or social events are prohibited, and the police can intervene in house parties. This is where politics comes in, which perhaps could or should be at a higher level than politics (laws, regulations, recommendations), but if as a society we are not capable of meeting the minimum, how do we expect to improve Latin America? Someone could also ask me, why should we improve Latin America? And why do we complain if we are part and the root of the problem? It's a problem of the individual, society, and the system, lack of ethical, philosophical, logical, and psychological education, more than religion.

Let's see how this day progresses, which is not over yet. Leave your comments if you have arguments to continue the debate or conversation.
