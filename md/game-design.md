Analysis of the Video Game Design Course (Platzi)
</h3>

Here I begin my analysis of Platzi's Video Game Design Course, specifically on the section "Discovering the Basics of Game Design."

"You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation" - Plato.
It reminded me of the classic phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words," if a video game is thousands of moving and interactive images with sounds, then I can affirm that a video game is worth more than thousands of images.

"Movies and books are monologues, games are conversations."
Since in life we have many conversations, interactions and decisions, I consider life an ultra-complex video game in which you have one life and if you are born in Latin America, it can be even more complex, depending on other initial factors that are not entirely fair, but we are already born, so there is nothing left to do but play. However, games are usually defined as closed systems or with limited decision-making possibilities, when our lives may also be like that, perhaps we have many possibilities like in open-world games, but not infinite. What is true is that these decisions are irreversible and impactful until the end of our lives and the end of the universe.

I liked Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen's definition better, personally I like to make things deeper and more philosophical, so my definition of a game would be broader and more flexible.

"A game is composed of zero or more elements within a system or not, in which players or non-players interact or not, in a conflict or social interaction or activity or nonsense, defined by strict or non-strict rules, without rules or with freedom of rules for interaction or not, which has quantifiable qualitative results or no results, but is something that can be played or not played."

So game design for me would be:

"Definition of zero or more elements within a system or not, with interaction or not that occurs between these elements or non-elements, in which players or non-players interact or not, in a conflict or social interaction or artificial activity or nonsense, defined by strict or non-strict rules, without rules or with freedom of rules that has quantifiable qualitative results or no results, so that it can be played or not played."

Regarding the game designer, "A game designer is a teacher who teaches his students without being present." This is true if we consider educational games or those that teach, but there are non-serious games with non-educational approaches that are not bad, others that teach without educational approaches, but the point is that the game designer is not only a teacher but also a designer, an artist, and above all a communicator. The art, teaching, and feelings reflected in their video game are communicated to the users or players if they have them, if not, it is still a communication that the artist has with himself, discovering more about himself as a game designer and as a person, philosophy, and discovering what he wants to reflect and communicate to the world and to himself.

Regarding the teacher Humberto Cervera, I thank him very much for this course, so far it seems to be one of the best I have taken on Platzi. I aspire to teach, and I would like to have that philosophical style of definitions and questioning, although many teachers have charisma, I think it is more accurate and important to have a fundamental way of thinking and trying not to have things written in stone or golden rules, really making their students think.

In the course, someone commented something correct and that is often affirmed: that the game has these characteristics:

-It is composed of a closed system, in which two or more parts are involved to generate interaction.

-It is a formal system where rules and regulations are included that guide the type of interaction.

-In its structure there must always be a beginning and an end, with the end being an unequal outcome where one of the involved parties ends up being the winner, whether it's a player against another or a player against the game itself.

Game design is often defined as the creation of a closed system that works with limited possibilities, which the player will explore, creating their own meaning, whether it is to complete the game or a more transcendent meaning.

But from my perspective, I affirm that like any rule, it can be broken, perhaps not now, maybe in the future, or maybe they have already been broken and we did not notice or did not find out.

It can be an open system, connecting 2 video games more feasibly with web3.0 and blockchain, it could be considered a video game where only the system/game acts, taking data and the player does not actively participate, or it could be a cyborg human integrated with a video game which would interact with itself, meaning only one party.

It can be an informal system where rules and regulations that guide the type of interaction are not included, for example, changing code by AI or randomness, or simply programmers constantly changing the rules with updates or variable modifications. In its structure, there may be a beginning and an end, with the end being an unequal or equal result where one of the involved parties may end up being the winner, whether it's a player against another or a player against the game itself or against themselves, or the machine against the machine. For example: there are loops in video games, procedural games or games with procedural generation, infinite games, open-world games with perhaps not infinite possibilities; but if there are so many possibilities, it would be very difficult to quantify them, plus users enter all the time, which increases the number of possibilities, so there are no concrete endings. Endings can also be considered if you stop playing, although the impact of these video games can also be considered part of the same, that is, although you stopped playing, the video game changed the course of the person's life and therefore the universe forever, and we do not know if it is infinite or if there are many or infinite universes.

Regarding "what game design is not", someone commented "designing games is creating games", I believe that perhaps that would be production, direction, or all the teams of programming, narrative, voices, graphics, and sounds. Although the designer must also know how to create them, otherwise, it would not make sense to design something that you will not carry out, in my opinion, or in any case, have the money or contacts willing and with the capabilities to carry out your idea, but their job is not to create them, but to define how they will be created, how they should be and how they have clear or blurry images of the "finished" video game in their brain, since every good product never ends, but let's say an acceptable initial version or where they plan to reach in a first instance.

On the class about "What is fun?" I believe that a game does not necessarily generate fun or learning, but rather feelings, activities or routines, or challenges. We may play to talk with friends and gather, out of habit to play something we enjoyed before, to improve in that game, or to have something to do. And like everything, too much of something can be harmful like any content, drugs, too much information overload, or acceleration of content can affect the brain and its functioning or paralyze it, or be internally very accelerated but physically not be able to take action. I wrote this after the class on the eight types of fun, so it depends on the definitions that are taken into consideration for "fun" for what I wrote to be valid.

On the teacher's comment "it has more to do with alchemy than with science" I disagree, while art is not entirely based on science, those who have broader knowledge can have better artistic results, if we consider science as a set of knowledge, art is also a science, and art is studied, taught, and there are accepted consensuses that can be considered advice, such as color psychology, etc. As I read when I was thinking about why the use of Artificial Intelligence in art seems amazing, it is because it discovers patterns that humans follow or have unconsciously or undefined, or not so well-studied, but still have them, that is, we create art with patterns, which can and is studied. While the "exact sciences" or "number careers" advance in studying the why of phenomena in the "non-exact sciences," these "non-exact sciences" are also advancing in the course and vision of humanity, beyond what exists and is studied. Alchemy was one of those paths that humanity mistakenly followed, but the positive thing may have been that, as in research, it had to be done to discover that it did not work, video games also develop, and most will not have the initial success they think they will, just like in entrepreneurship, just like with blogs or content, just like with research.

About narrative fun, it does not necessarily have to be from point A to point B, as there can be multiple initial points A: A1, A2, etc., and equally multiple end points... as I mentioned in procedural generation video games, like in open-world or multiplayer games.

![Technology, Mechanics, and Narrative](/img/SS/Blogs/disenno-videojuegos3.png)

Regarding this image in the class "Where does a game come from?", the flow from narrative to mechanics is missing, you can start by defining the narrative or art that the video game will have, and that leads to deciding what mechanics to use to tell that story.

Since everything is connected, in everything, not just in video games, although not every connection is significant or 100% known, it exists, but in the field of video game development, this connection is more present since they are components of a system, that is, parts of a whole that connect to make a whole. Also, other artistic productions can be taken as references, and one or some of these productions may be purely or focused on narratives, not necessarily only video games.
