Notes and Analysis on Ethics and Deontology - (2/2)
</h3>

<h4 class="blue-text text-darken-3">Professional Statics</h4>

Should professionals always intervene according to their own ideology? Whether it is personal or acquired, but from an individual perspective in circumstances and decision-making, rather than following rules that are law or suggestions considered ethical in deontology. While everyone has their individual perspectives and ideologies, society progresses together, but at the same time, ethics and deontology tell us that they are above the law and possibly better than it if applied correctly. Therefore, we should act according to our individual maxims, as long as the situation warrants a better solution to the problem, considering or not the consequences with the time and resources we would have to react.

There will always be resources and consequences to pay for each action. If the situation permits, we could use utilitarian techniques such as cost-benefit, assuming various resources. Techniques, ethics, and deontology should evolve alongside the evolution of professions over time and not be bureaucratic or immovable paradigms, as society is not like that. There are widely known examples of paradoxes and "dilemmas" of false dichotomy, such as the thought experiment of the trolley problem:
"A trolley is running out of control on a track. In its path are five people who have been tied up and can't move. Fortunately, you can flip a switch that will lead the trolley down a different track to safety. But there is a single person tied up on that track. Should you flip the switch?"

But in reality, we have equally or more complex situations than in fantasy, such as doctors evaluating who has the feasibility of being saved, due to the large number of patients.

Organizational Philosophy, as another means to an end, linked to strategic plans, MOF (organization and function manuals) should not only be mission, vision, values, etc., it should be dynamic, in constant improvement and change, not to be in organizational statics, not only as a document but which ends up translating into the functioning of the organization and its perception by the public. Organizations may or may not know this, but as imperfect humans with negativity, we are tied to mediocrity. Generally, these documents or descriptions are created when the company is initiated or on defined dates after a period, as if those were the best dates, like just another document, out of obligation or because others do it, they may not even be created in the best way, without even understanding the meanings of organizational philosophy, mission, vision, values, and the true reason for their objectives, goals, rules, procedures, processes, internal policies, and advertisements.

Continuing on professional and organizational statics, let's talk about the University, inefficient organizations that update their curricula every few years when knowledge evolves at higher frequencies, such as daily when research is published about the profession, but they are "stable" and excusing themselves that they explain the fundamentals of the profession, teach about research, give general knowledge, and have access to organizations or validation of your knowledge, such as the bureaucratic state and traditional organizations. But there is no greater validation of your knowledge than the knowledge itself, its application to knowledge, and the teaching or communication of it. Good organizations value more: your knowledge, portfolios with applied projects, research, or communications made than your papers.

This static is probably linked to the mediocrity or stability that is sought or perpetuated. With other stupid phrases like "shoemaker to his shoe," "if you wish hard enough, you will get it," or "the good will come," without working for it to happen or doing it, but not knowing that perhaps that alone is not enough to improve.

Similarly, it is important to keep in mind that professionals must be clear about what they are responsible for and what they are not. This involves considering the interconnection of professions and the difficulty of delineating fields of action. Just because someone studies a profession does not mean that they only know that profession or even know it well. What I mean is that we must know our own abilities and limitations, as well as those of others, and not rely on simplistic things like a label on a document or piece of paper. As professionals, we must be responsible to ourselves, our communities, and society.

I write this without having a profession in philosophy, psychology, science, or any social science. I hope that professionals in these fields will critique or help me improve my content, but it is important to be honest and say that I am sharing this because with the limited knowledge I have, I want to support society and retain my own learning.

In my profession, systems engineering, there is often a dynamic interplay between knowledge and professions (such as designers, marketers, administrators, financiers, and other engineering fields). If you create multidisciplinary teams focused on objectives, you will achieve better results than with monotonous and homogeneous teams that think similarly. The same goes for knowledge. We must be able to take interest and action to obtain multidisciplinary knowledge for better results.

The Deontological Code should be socialized and made known to society, especially service users, so that professions can be taken seriously.

It is also possible that there is no correlation between the existence of a deontological code in a profession and the quality of services provided. The code may not be considered a personal standard but rather something imposed as a mere requirement to obtain professional certification, or as an excuse for charging higher fees or to provide a sense of belonging to a community. The code may also be ineffective in practice, purely decorative, or an ornament that elicits respect and consideration, with unrealistic self-promotion and no practical effect.

It can also lead to closed-mindedness in order to prevent any kind of "intrusion," even though, as I mentioned earlier, someone may have knowledge of a profession without having studied it at a university. However, it is essential to be aware of the knowledge one possesses. In certain professions, it can be difficult to determine boundaries, which can lead to abuses instead of protection or justice.

Powerful and influential groups responsible for curtailing rather than stimulating public debate can use the code to limit progress and change. A profession is dynamic and changing; a problem is dynamic and presents itself with other intertwined problems; a situation in which intervention begins may have other nuances tomorrow and may even be very different by the end of the intervention. Therefore, the deontological code should be open, not coercive, but guiding. Ultimately, the code cannot be a closed and coercive recipe, like civil codes.
